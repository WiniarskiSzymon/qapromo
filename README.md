Sadly i had some trouble so you have to run tests manually - not by mvn test.
I had some trabolues with welcome pop up at first login - sometimes it wa sshowing and sometimes not.
I've made test scenario which include this pop up.
I assumed that log in is made by the same user that just have registered and create wizard is showing for this user after login.
Also in this repo I've added STD from first quest. Estimated time ~60 min, startin with my first opening of your page/application.
